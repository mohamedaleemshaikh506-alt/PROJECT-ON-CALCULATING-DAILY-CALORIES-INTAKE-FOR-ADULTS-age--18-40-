# PROJECT-ON-CALCULATING-DAILY-CALORIES-INTAKE-FOR-ADULTS-age--18-40-


In researching a calorie intake tracking project, start with nutritional science and software parallels. Daily calorie needs vary by age, gender, and activity—e.g., USDA guidelines recommend 1,800-2,500 kcal for adults, with balanced meals (breakfast ~400-500 kcal, lunch/dinner ~600-800, snacks ~200-300). Studies from the Journal of the American Dietetic Association highlight apps like MyFitnessPal for self-monitoring, reducing obesity risks by 20-30% via feedback. For C implementation, reference "C Programming: A Modern Approach" by K.N. King for scanf/printf and conditionals, and open-source health trackers on GitHub (e.g., console-based BMI calculators). Explore embedded health devices (e.g., wearables interfacing via C), emphasizing user-friendly prompts to encourage accurate logging. This phase uncovers the need for validation to prevent data errors, as invalid inputs skew health advice.
Analysis
The code analyzes daily calorie intake across four meals, computing a sum ("average") and evaluating against thresholds: Warn if any meal <450 kcal, and congratulate if sum >=1800, else advise completion. Strengths: Clear sequential input prompts, personalized output with emojis for engagement, and logical health messaging promoting balanced nutrition. Weaknesses: Critical bug—average = sum without /4, leading to inflated values (e.g., 2000 kcal sum prints as 2000.00 average); minor typos (e.g., "Entercalories" missing space); no input validation (negative/zero calories possible); condition overlap (first if catches low meals but doesn't exit, so else-if may trigger incorrectly). Requirements: Accurate calculation, user feedback. Constraints: Console-only, assumes integer inputs. Feasibility: Simple for education; SWOT: Strengths (health-focused), Weaknesses (bugs in math/logic), Opportunities (mobile integration), Threats (user input errors affecting advice reliability).
